# Data Analysis Hub

This repository contains multiple data analysis projects focused on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling. Each project is structured to demonstrate practical analytical workflows and clear insight generation.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to build a strong data analytics portfolio by:
* Solving end-to-end analytical problems
* Practicing reproducible workflows
* Applying statistical and machine learning techniques
* Presenting insights in a clear and interpretable format

## Contents

* Notebooks for exploratory data analysis
* Scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing
* Modeling experiments including classification and regression
* Visualization work to highlight patterns and insights

## Tools and Skills Demonstrated

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
* Scikit-learn for modeling and evaluation
* Data wrangling and feature engineering
* Structured analytical workflows

## Notes

Each project includes:
* Problem definition
* Dataset overview
* Step-by-step analysis
* Key insights and conclusions
* Model evaluation when applicable

The repository will continue to expand with more datasets and analytical techniques.
